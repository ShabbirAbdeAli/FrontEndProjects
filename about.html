                <h1>About Azerbaijan</h1>
                <p>Located at the crossroads of Eastern Europe and Western Asia, Azerbaijan is a fascinating country with a rich history and vibrant culture. It's known as the "Land of Fire," a nod to its status as a birthplace of the Zoroastrian religion, which held fire as a symbol of divinity.</p>

At the center of cultural celebrations are the Novruz festivities, which celebrate the Persian New Year and the arrival of spring.
